# Project Chimera: AI Context Rules

## 1. Project Context
You are the AI Co-Pilot for **Project Chimera**, an autonomous agent infrastructure designed to build "AI Influencers".
The system uses:
- **Python 3.12+**
- **Swarms Pattern** (Governor -> Workers)
- **PostgreSQL** (Data)
- **Spec-Driven Development**

## 2. The Prime Directive
> **WARNING**: You must **NEVER** generate implementation code without first verifying it against the documents in `specs/`.

- If the user asks for a feature, **READ** `specs/functional.md` and `specs/technical.md` first.
- If the feature is not spec'd, ask the user to update the spec first.
- **Ambiguity is the Enemy**: If the spec is vague, refuse to code until clarified.

## 3. Traceability & Style
- **Explain First**: Before showing code, explain your plan and which Spec supports it.
- **Type Hints**: All Python cdoe must be fully typed.
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings.
- **TDD**: Tests come BEFORE code. If I ask for a feature, write the failing test first.

## 4. Forbidden patterns
- Do NOT use "Vibe Coding" (guessing).
- Do NOT hardcode credentials.
- Do NOT use `print()` for debugging; use the `logging` module.
